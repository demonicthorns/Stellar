          <p>
            Science (from the Latin word scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a
            systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the
            form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
            The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and
            Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.

          <p>
            Science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many
            historical civilizations. Modern science is distinct in its approach
            and successful in its results, so it now defines what science is in
            the strictest sense of the term. Science in its original sense was a
            word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the
            pursuit of such knowledge. In particular, it was the type of
            knowledge that people can communicate to each other and share. For
            example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered
            long before recorded history and led to the development of complex
            abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex
            calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, public
            works at a national scale, such as those which harnessed the
            floodplain of the Yangtse with reservoirs, dams, and dikes, and
            buildings such as the Pyramids. However, no consistent conscious
            distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are
            true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such
            as mythologies and legal systems. Metallurgy was known in
            prehistory, and the Vinƒça culture was the earliest known producer of
            bronze-like alloys. It is thought that early experimentation with
            heating and mixing of substances over time developed into alchemy.

            The Human Genome Project was completed in 2003, determining the
            sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and
            identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome.
            Induced pluripotent stem cells were developed in 2006, a technology
            allowing adult cells to be transformed into stem cells capable of
            giving rise to any cell type found in the body, potentially of huge
            importance to the field of regenerative medicine.[106] With the
            discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the last particle predicted by
            the Standard Model of particle physics was found. In 2015,
            gravitational waves, predicted by general relativity a century
            before, were first observed. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope
            Observatory announced its first results in simultaneous press
            conferences around the world on April 10, 2019. Press conferences
            presented the first direct image of a black hole, where the
            supermassive black hole appeared in the heart of the galaxy Messier
            87, which is 55 million light-years away from Earth

              <p>
                A powered exoskeleton, also known as power armor, powered armor, powered suit, cybernetic suit, cybernetic armor, exosuit, hardsuit, exoframe or augmented mobility, is a mobile machine that is wearable over all or part of the human body, providing ergonomic structural support and powered by a system of electric motors, pneumatics, levers, hydraulics or a combination of cybernetic technologies, while allowing for sufficient limb movement with increased strength and endurance. The exoskeleton is designed to provide better mechanical load tolerance, and its control system aims to sense and synchronize with the user's intended motion and relay the signal to motors which manage the gears. The exoskeleton also protects the user's shoulder, waist, back and thigh against overload, and stabilizes movements when lifting and holding heavy items.
      A powered exoskeleton differs from a passive exoskeleton, as the latter has no intrinsic actuator and relies completely on the user's own muscles for movements, adding more stress and making the user more prone to fatigue, although it does provide mechanical benefits and protection to the user. This also explains the difference of an exoskeleton to orthotics, as orthosis mainly aims to promote the progressively increased muscle work and, in the best case, regain and improve existing muscle functions.
